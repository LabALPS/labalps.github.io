Since its establishment in 2010, ALPS has been expanded and enhanced, and is now home to a range of advanced technologies and tools. The lab has a strong focus on laboratory phonology, the study of articulation, acoustics, and perception of the sounds of human language. However, its affiliation with the Faculty of Education of the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano provides a strong academic framework for conducting projects in related fields of research. A great emphasis is given to projects in the field of sociophonetics, the study of how language varies according to social factors, such as age, gender, and region.
